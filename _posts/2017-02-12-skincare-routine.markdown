It might give me pimples.

If you’re like me, then you could probably relate to all of that. =)) I don’t wear heavy makeup that’s why I don’t feel the need to invest on skin care.
I haven’t really established a good skin care routine until recently (January 2017). I’ve just been happy  using a simple soap and water for my face and felt it sufficed. Sometimes when I felt too tired, I just rinsed my face with water and I was good to go.

When me and my Mama went to Watsons, she bought some cleansers while I took a lot of time looking at new makeup at the counter. (haha)

She placed the Neutrogena foaming cleanser at our sink inside the comfort room so I decided to try it out and my oh my, I have never felt so squeaky clean ever!!! Hahahaha Ever since that night, I forced myself to step into the skincare world. =)))

Fortunately for me, my Mama is inclined into skincare so it’s a bit easier for me to try out new things.  ;) In Papa’s latest trip to Manila, Mama called him to buy something at Miniso. And luckily for us, Papa follows directions so well and he was able to buy this one! ;) It’s retailed for 749 pesos at Miniso!

It feeeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllsssssssssssssss sooooooooooooo goooooooooooooooooooodddddd!!! I could sleep while using it on my face. Haha that’s how relaxing it makes me feel. And it also steps up the game for any kind of cleanser. It makes my skin so soft and squeaky clean! Thankfully it automatically turns off after 60 seconds (yup I timed it)  At least you won't be wasting time (like what I planned to do the 1st time I tried it haha)

At the start of the year I’ve been using this Neutrogena but this MUZ Skin whitening exfoliator is my Mama’s new favorite! I had to try it out too. I like it because of the microbeads it has that makes the cleaning more efficient. We bought it at 7-11 Tibanga and I like how it came in a sachet like this because when it comes to trying out new products, we’d love to test out the different ones first before investing in a full-sized product. (tipid tips haha) I tried the Pond's one once and a baby pimple grew on my forehead so I stopped using it thereafter. =)))

If you're planning to buy any of these 2, please save yourself from the heartache. Hahaha I don't really find them useful.. but when I do put mascara on, I use this before washing my face. I've heard good things about the Garnier Micellar water so I'll probably be trying that when I empty these out. ;)

I’d moisturize at night with my Nivea Creme (the blue one in a small circle can) because the aircondition can dry my face too much. I rediscovered this product and gave it another chance because of an article I’ve read a few years back and it got me totally convinced to purchase! Haha! I only use it at night because it makes my face really greasy when I wake up in the morning.

I’m still a skincare beginner and so I have yet to discover more! (Thus nothing really too much to share on this post too, haha)

I hope this encourages you to take good care of your skin now and invest on a good skincare routine. How about you? What are your skincare essentials? What can you recommend? Thank you! <3
