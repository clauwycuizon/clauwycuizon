**Year 2017**. WOW! Did 2016 just flew by like that? I can hardly remember taking any moments to stop and rest because I feel like I was all over the place in 2016.

This year, one of my goals is to **WRITE MORE**.
I’ve always loved keeping up-to-date with my *journal* and *planner*, and ever since high school I **TRIED** to maintain my blogs. (Multiply, Xanga, Tmblr, Wordpress). Like I said I felt like I’ve been all over the place. But I want to give myself a better chance in growing this year. That means I have to be more focused on the things I want to do, and be better in letting go some of the things that I find not adding value to my life (Char.) 

A few days after the new year, my very kind and loving (haha) brother, offered to design my own webpage. My heart skipped a beat. It was like hearing the name of your first crush ever. I giggled inside with excitement. But of course I had to hide it and plainly said, “sure”. LOL

When I wrote my goals for this year just before the clock ticked 12 mn in time for 2017, I prayed to God to sanctify the things that I have written. True indeed, He made a way for me in one of my goals – through my brother. (Thank you Kuya for this!)

Anyway, my motivation for my blogs ever since wasn’t (and ISN’T) the number of readers I get, but plainly for me.(Wow selfish? Haha) I’ve always loved writing and sometime in the future, I know looking back to my entries would bring so much delight to my spirit. I am a memory hoarder and writing is one way of capturing a moment. To share the details, to know what’s running inside your mind, and to be able to relive your experience during those moments. This is the reward of documentation. haha

I don’t have anything specific to put up in here, but I pray that whoever may stumble upon my blog will find it useful, fun and a blessing. 
So, uhmmm (awkward smile). How about we start with the basics?

Hi! My name is **Venice Claudine Capuno Cuizon**. You can call me **_Clauwy_**.

I am 20-ish years young (although I can still be able to convince someone I am 17 haha).

I am in my junior year in medschool (wooohoooo!!!! Laban lang!!!)

I am a registered nurse.

I love Jesus Christ! <3

I love to laugh and play around, but I am focused on what needs to be done (meaning I can be serious if I have to)

I love baking, cooking, painting, BABIEEEEEEEEES, my friends, my family, and makeup! 

I love PINK but I learned to appreciate yellow now that I’m older. It just brings so much sunshine and happiness.

I love seafoods! 

I love bandaids.

I don’t share umbrellas. Sahree.

I am a people-person. If you ask me if what I’ll bring if I’m on an island alone, NEVER MIND. I can't live ALONE. =))))

I desire to grow more in the love and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. That is why I enjoy waking up every morning because I get to know Him better everyday through the different ups and downs of my life.

And to you who’s reading this, THANK YOU! :P You could be a close friend, a classmate, a friend, a stranger, but I thank you for dropping by and getting curious about me advertising myself (probably in facebook haha)

Cheers to more intentional deeds! And I’d like to put it here to remind myself. “You always have time, IF YOU MAKE TIME.”

See you around. 
