In one of the most terrifying points in my life, this is the story that a friend reminded me. I believe we’re so familiar with it. But sometimes familiarity causes us to overlook a beautiful revelation hidden amidst a very common Bible story.
\
It gave me a better perspective, and when burdensome situations come, this revelation reminds me of where my faith stands on.

\*\*Luke 8:22 -25 \*\*

### \*22 One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, “Let us go across to the other side of the lake.” So they started out.

\
23 As they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. Suddenly a strong wind blew down on the lake, and the boat began to fill with water, so that they were all in great danger.
\
24 The disciples went to Jesus and woke him up, saying, “Master, Master! We are about to die!”
Jesus got up and gave an order to the wind and to the stormy water; they quieted down, and there was a great calm.
\
25 Then he said to the disciples, “Where is your faith?” But they were amazed and afraid, and said to one another, “Who is this man? He gives orders to the winds and waves, and they obey him!”

When the strong winds blew down and threatened the lives of the disciples, they lost track of what Jesus had said when He got into the boat. - “Let us go across to the other side of the lake.”

### 

Are you somewhere in your life too that everything just feels too much? That the situation isn’t really looking like what you hoped for? That you feel the strong winds of life are bringing you down and the waters are making you breathless?

\
Too many exams and requirements in school.

\
Business not going too well as expected.

\
Plans too big to materialize.

\
Relationships that are beyond fixing.

\
Unable to join in a group.

\
People talking bad things about you.

\
No progress in your career.

\
No peace of mind and contentment in your heart?

\
Failures. Setbacks. Pain.

\
Then just like what Jesus told His disciples, He’s also telling you now, “Let us go across to the other side of the lake.”
\
Hold on to God’s Word, and know that it is only **FAITH** that pleases Him.
\
Strong winds may threaten your life, and some water may go inside the boat, but BELIEVE in your heart that by all means – You shall reach the other side.

\
The other side may mean victory, safe land, peace, restoration, (probably graduation haha), achieving your dreams, or in my case, finishing med school.

\
We all have different storms and different “other sides”. But one thing’s for sure – When we put our faith in the One who is never failing, we will get to the other side of the lake.

\
God bless you! Happy Sunday! <3
