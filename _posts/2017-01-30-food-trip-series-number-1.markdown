If you’re in Iligan, you probably had the same kind of conversation with your friends at least once. There aren’t just too many options in our city that is why I am inspired to search out for places that are just a hole in the wall but offers great food. ;)

Last January 23, 2017, after our clinical correlates lecture with Doc Van, my classmates and I decided to try Aianna's Japanese snacks and Grill-It-Yourself Yakimix  as recommended by the one and only LL! ;)

To our disappointment, the place was still being renovated and we found ourselves lost in the middle of a complete state of hunger and desperation. LOL

The owner of the place was very kind and accommodating enough to shed some hope to our misery ---- after standing outside for quite some time to think of where to eat, she offered to serve us and even buy the rice for us. (Awwwweeee) We waited for a few minutes for them to set up a small table and sweep off some of the mess from the construction. Thank you so much Ma’am for allowing us to have early access! Their official reopening was scheduled the next day and we felt very honored and happy despite being so hungry!

They have 3 special sauces:
Curry,barbecue, and my personal favorite: Garlic Butter

A plate of pork meat is for 55 pesos while beef is 75 pesos.

Another one we really enjoyed is the Okonomiyaki – it is a Japanese savoury pancake containing a variety of ingredients. The name is derived from the word okonomi, meaning "how you like" or "what you like", and yaki meaning "grill" (oh diba research haha). It’s for 35 pesos.

They also offer Takoyaki, which is a ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special moulded pan. I don’t know how much it was. They gave it for free because it was our dearest Vina’s birthday on my 2nd day eating there . (Happy birthday, Vinnyboo!) They also gave her a free bottle of softdrink! Sweet!

I don’t really cook so I had a hard time deciding whether the meat is ready to eat or still yet has to sit and simmer. Hahahaha so sad =)) But overall, the experience with your friends is great!

I tried grill-it-yourself buffets but what sets Aianna’s apart from others is how they are very much budget-friendly. Especially for students like me, you can enjoy grilling  with your friends for such a low price, and it tastes really great too!

I highly recommend this to all Iliganons out there! It is located at Pala-o, in between Shoppe 24 and B-Bu-Q.
