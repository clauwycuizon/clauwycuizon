If you think I'll be sharing to you the conventional study tips or "how to study" lists, then I'm sorry to burst your bubble. Hahahahhaha

I've tried a lot of strategies to keep myself up in the wee hours of the morning to study. Studying out, coffee (yes, I tried twice since the new year began huhu), napping before studying, downloading crazy alarms, taking a cold bath before studying...

But this has to be one of the best discoveries I have yet!

Mama bought this for 39 pesos at Rose Pharmacy. I instantly loved it because of the Panda  packaging! Hihi

On my study break (around 11pm) I decided to use this because I felt like my eyes were too heavy from all the reading. And boy was I surprised!!!! It made me feel sooooo awake! The coolness and the stickiness of the mask keeps you from closing your eyes!

Go try for yourself! Aside from being able to read more and being wide awake, it soothes your undereye area! That's like hitting so many birds with one stone!
